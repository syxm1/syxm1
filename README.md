### Hi, I'm syxm1! ðŸ‘‹

###### ****Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure what to write here, so let me just show you my daily setup instead.***

Hereâ€™s a quick peek at my setup: <br>

My development environment is built on [***Arch Linux running in WSL***](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) under Windows, giving me the best of both worldsâ€”native Windows compatibility with a full-fledged Linux toolkit. For my terminal needs, I rely on [***WezTerm***](https://wezterm.org/), a fast, feature-rich GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that handles my workflows smoothly. Inside it, I use [***Zsh***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) as my primary shell, enhanced with plugins and custom configurations for productivity.

I love to use Vim motions when it comes to editing. [***Neovim***](https://neovim.io/) is my go-toâ€”lightning-fast, endlessly extensible, and perfectly tailored to my programming style. To manage sessions, multiplex terminals, and keep everything organized, I wrap it all in [***tmux***](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), allowing seamless context switching and persistent workflows.

Feel free to grab my configs and modify them your own!
