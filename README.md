*Actually, I don't really know what to write here so, let me introduce you to my daily drive set-up.

My development environment is built on [Arch Linux running in WSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) under Windows, giving me the best of both worlds—native Windows compatibility with a full-fledged Linux toolkit. For my terminal needs, I rely on [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org/), a fast, feature-rich GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that handles my workflows smoothly. Inside it, I use [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) as my primary shell, enhanced with plugins and custom configurations for productivity.

I love to use Vim motions when it comes to editing. [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is my go-to—lightning-fast, endlessly extensible, and perfectly tailored to my programming style. To manage sessions, multiplex terminals, and keep everything organized, I wrap it all in [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), allowing seamless context switching and persistent workflows.

This is the preview of my set-up. <br>
